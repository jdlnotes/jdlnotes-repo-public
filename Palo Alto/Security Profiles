
Security profiles provide threat protection in Security Policy. Each Security policy rule can include one or more Security Profiles. The following are available profile types:

Antivirus profiles to protect against worms, viruses, and trojans and to block spyware downloads. See Objects > Security Profiles > Antivirus.

Anti-Spyware profiles to block attempts from spyware on compromised hosts trying to phone-home or beacon out to external command-and-control (C2) servers. See Objects > Security Profiles > Anti-Spyware Profile.

Vulnerability protection profiles to stop attempts to exploit system flaws or gain unauthorized access to systems. See Objects > Security Profiles > Vulnerability Protection.

URL filtering profiles to restrict users access to specific websites and/or website categories, such as shopping or gambling. See Objects > Security Profiles > URL Filtering.

File blocking profiles to block selected file types, and in the specified session flow direction (inbound/outbound/both). See Objects > Security Profiles > File Blocking.

WildFireâ„¢ analysis profiles to specify for file analysis to be performed locally on the WildFire appliance or in the WildFire cloud. See Objects > Security Profiles > WildFire Analysis.

Data filtering profiles that help prevent sensitive information such as credit card or social security numbers from leaving a protected network. See Objects > Security Profiles > Data Filtering.

DoS Protection profiles are used with DoS Protection policy rules to protect the firewall from high-volume single-session and multiple-session attacks. See Objects > Security Profiles > DoS Protection.

GTP Protection profiles enables the firewall to inspect, validate and filter GTP traffic. See Objects > Security Profiles > GTP Protection

In additional to individual profiles, you can combine profiles that are often applied together, and create Security Profile groups (ObjectsSecurity Profile Groups).
